# Flower Species Image Classifier

This repository contains code for an image classifier that can identify the species of flowers using deep learning techniques. The code is built with Python and TensorFlow. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation should be organized in the following structure:

dataset/
├── daisy/
│ ├── daisy_image_1.jpg
│ ├── daisy_image_2.jpg
│ └── ...
├── rose/
│ ├── rose_image_1.jpg
│ ├── rose_image_2.jpg
│ └── ...
├── sunflower/
│ ├── sunflower_image_1.jpg
│ ├── sunflower_image_2.jpg
│ └── ...
├── tulip/
│ ├── tulip_image_1.jpg
│ ├── tulip_image_2.jpg
│ └── ...
└── ...
